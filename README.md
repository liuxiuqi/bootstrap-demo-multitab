To install:

git clone https://github.com/stephaneerard/bootstrap-demo-multitab --recursive

All files are included (jquery, jquery-ui and the specifics of multitab).

This is a demo.

Its purpose is to be bundled as a jquery+bootstrap plugin in the near future.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thank you !
